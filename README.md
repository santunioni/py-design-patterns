Stores basic examples of design patterns written in python.
It also provides a shell app to navigate between the aplications written with the patterns.

All examples are derived from https://refactoring.guru. Not all patterns are implemented yet.
I am implementing as practice as I re-read the book.

Patterns already implemented:

**Creational:**
provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- [x] Factory Method
- [ ] Abstract Factory
- [ ] Builder
- [ ] Prototype
- [ ] Singleton

**Structural:**:
explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Facade
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Proxy

**Behavioral:**
concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- [ ] Chain of Responsability
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] State
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Template Method
- [ ] Visitor


Run the shell app with:    
```python
python -m patterns
```
